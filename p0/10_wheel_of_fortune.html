      <h2>Cycles, Destiny, and Divine Intervention</h2>
      </p>

      <p>
        Our exploration of the Rider-Waite Tarot Deck brings us to the Wheel of Fortune, a symbol of cycles, destiny, and
        divine intervention. In this card, a wheel turns, and various figures, representing the four fixed signs of the
        zodiac—Leo, Taurus, Scorpio, and Aquarius—occupy each corner. A sphinx sits atop the wheel, symbolizing mystery,
        wisdom, and the enigmatic forces that govern the cycles of life.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Wheel of Fortune represents the ever-turning wheel of fate, where individuals experience the highs and lows of
        life. The figures on the wheel symbolize the inevitable changes that come with the passage of time, and the sphinx
        reflects the wisdom required to navigate these cycles with grace and understanding.
      </p>

      <p>
        The outer circle of the wheel is inscribed with the letters T, A, R, and O, which spell "TARO," suggesting a
        connection
        to the tarot itself and the cyclical nature of the human experience. The wheel turns in both directions,
        highlighting the cyclical nature of life's experiences and the perpetual movement of destiny.
      </p>

      <p>
        In a tarot reading, the Wheel of Fortune often emerges as a reminder of the cyclical nature of life, the influence of
        fate, and the interconnectedness of all things. It signifies a time of change, both in external circumstances and
        internal growth, and encourages individuals to adapt to the shifting tides of destiny.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Wheel of Fortune also emphasizes the role of divine intervention and the mysterious forces that guide the course
        of one's life. It suggests that some events are beyond personal control, and individuals are urged to surrender to the
        natural flow of destiny.
      </p>

      <p>
        From a psychological perspective, the Wheel of Fortune represents the acceptance of life's ups and downs, embracing
        change, and understanding that personal growth often comes through experiencing a variety of circumstances. It
        encourages individuals to navigate the cycles with resilience and openness to the lessons each phase brings.
      </p>

      <p>
        In a reversed position, the Wheel of Fortune may suggest resistance to change, a fear of the unknown, or a reluctance
        to accept the cyclical nature of life. It could indicate a need for surrendering control and embracing the inherent
        uncertainties of the journey. In such cases, the reversed Wheel of Fortune serves as a gentle reminder to trust the
        unfolding of destiny and find wisdom in the midst of change.
      </p>

      <p>
        Archetypally, the Wheel of Fortune aligns with the archetype of destiny and the cosmic order that governs the cycles
        of life. It symbolizes the interconnectedness of all beings and the unfolding of events according to a higher plan.
      </p>

      <p>
        Societally, the Wheel of Fortune encourages communities to acknowledge the impermanence of circumstances and embrace
        change with resilience. It emphasizes the importance of adapting to the cycles of life and finding meaning in the
        ever-turning wheel of destiny.
      </p>

      <p>
        In conclusion, the Wheel of Fortune in the Rider-Waite Tarot Deck invites us to recognize the cyclical nature of life
        and embrace the mysteries of destiny. It encourages individuals to navigate change with openness, adaptability, and a
        willingness to surrender to the forces that guide the course of their journey.
